Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.


About the script and the tidy dataset
-------------------------------------
The script "run_analysis.R" does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Prerequisites for this script:
-------------------------------------
1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"
3. library data.table must be loaded

About the Code Book
-------------------
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
